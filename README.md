EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS OF COVID 19 INDIA DATASET¶ THIS DATA SET IS COLLECTED FROM - https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india  KAGGLE LINK OF THIS PROJECT:  GITHUB LINK OF THIS PROJECT:  NOTE : This dataset is getting updated continuously in the given link above. I download the dataset in .CSV format on [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41].  This notebook on Kaggle will not get affected as the data it is taking is also getting updated. But in other platforms (like Github) where I have uploaded the .CSV files downloaded on [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41]  Analysis can only be retrieved based on the data collected till [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41]. So it is suggested to use the KAGGLE link to view this Analysis to get the Analysis base4d on the latest data.
