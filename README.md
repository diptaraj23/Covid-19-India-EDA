##### NOTE : This dataset is getting updated continuously in the given link above. I download the dataset in .CSV format on [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41].  

This notebook on Kaggle will not get affected as the data it is taking is also getting updated. But in other platforms (like Github) where I have uploaded the .CSV files downloaded on [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41]  

Analysis can only be retrieved based on the data collected till [22 ‎April ‎2021, ‏‎22:34:41]. So it is suggested to use the KAGGLE link to view this Analysis to get the Analysis base4d on the latest data.

There are 3 dataset files (.csv files) of which I have used only 2 datasets to perform my EDA. The third dataset named "covid_vaccine_statewise" is attached to this same project. I will upload another Notebook analysing that data.
